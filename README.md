Adventure Redefined trades Minecraft's default music for something dynamic, reactive, and ever-changing. Including a collection of fantasy and celtic tracks to give an air of wonder, a whisper of the unknown, and the call of adventure.

Adventure Redefined is based off a music pack I originally made for the Ambience mod back in 1.12. Now rebuilt to be a standalone mod for modern minecraft.
